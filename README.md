# Picos
Yet another front-end library. Experimental/under development.

### Design goals

- Explicit reactivity
- Typescript-first, class-based components
- Lightweight & compact (target: <10K core lib)
- Immediate DOM manipulation (no VDOM overhead)
- Core SPA features:
  - Components
  - Routing
  - State management
- Usable for both small components & full-page SPAs
- Modular & treeshakeable
- Supported out-of-the-box by Parcel & Typescript, no additional tooling needed
